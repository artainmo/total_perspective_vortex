# Notions

### EEG datas:

Brainwaves, from voltage fluctuations between neurons.

### Dimensionality reduction algorithm: 

Is an unsupervised learning technique. That can also be used to pre-process data for supervised learning after cleaning the data and normalizing it. Different dimensionality reduction algorithms exist, no method is superior it depends on dataset and must be tested. They have to be fit and evaluated as well on training and test set.

Dimensionality reduction seeks a lower-dimensional representation of numerical input data that preserves the salient(most important) relationships in the data. This allows for a reduced number of parameters in your supervised learing model, simpler models are desirable.

### ML Pipeline:

ML workflows include data preparation, training and evaluation. ML pipelines automate the ML wworkflow and can be re-used on different datas to train or predict. Making the AI more reproducible.

###Real time data stream classification: 

Consists of a classifier that is trained in real time on incoming data and able to drift (adapt in real time), to stay accurate over time.
